Welcome to Shiftd Hockey!

We are excited to share with you our experience and knowledge of the game of hockey. Our team consists of current professional hockey players.

The Shiftd program is dedicated to making you better. Our process enables you to monitor your own progress. The trends that we see in your games will formulate your development plan.

How it works is simple:

1. Upload your game film
2. Our coaches will watch your game and take stats and write notes
3. Your game report will be sent back to you
4. You receive a 1-to-1 Mentorship session between you and your coach

Our program is uniquely designed to emphasize your development. Using our knowledge of the most current and relevant player assessment stats and philosophies, we can offer unparalleled insight into how to better yourself the right way; the current way.
